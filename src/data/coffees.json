But our washed Robusta is a rare find that balances out the Ispirazione Palermo Kazaar coffee pod with its clean taste and creamy texture. The other coffees are Latin American Arabicas that lend a natural sweetness to Ispirazione Palermo Kazaar.",
		"roasting_description": "We split roast the coffees to bring out distinct qualities of each coffee in the Ispirazione Palermo Kazaar blend. Most of the Arabica and Robusta get an intense roast to develop their bitterness and body. We give the unwashed Robusta a shorter and lighter roast to bring out some of the finer aromatic notes. Ispirazione Palermo Kazaar \u2019s roast style reflects the Arab and African influence you see across southern Italy\u2019s dark and intense coffees.",
